# 0x05. Unity - Assets: Models, Textures
# Specializations - AR/VR ― Unity
# By Carrie Ybay, Software Engineer at Holberton School

## Background Context
For the next few projects, we’ll be building a simple 3D platformer game (see example ) We encourage you to create development builds as you work and play test your game frequently.

## Learning Objectives
* What is an Asset and how to import and use them
* How to use Asset Packages and the Unity Asset Store
* What are common Asset types
* How to use Unity primitives as placeholders to prototype a project
* What are materials and how to use them
* What are textures and how to use them
* What is a skybox
* What is are the components of a 3D model
* What is a mesh
* How to create UI elements with image components
* What is a Rigidbody and what is a Character Controller and what are the pros and cons of using each
* What is a Quaternion

## Requirements
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
* Use Unity’s default .gitignore in your holbertonschool-unity directory
* Push the entire project folder 0x05-unity-assets_models_textures to your repo
* Scenes and project assets such as Scripts must be organized as described in the tasks
* In your scripts, all your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
* In your scripts, all your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags

## Task
Create a 3D Platformer while following requirements.

Skyboxes: Farland Skies - Cloudy Crown
